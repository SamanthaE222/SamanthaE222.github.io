## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 3, Part 1
I enjoyed this lab because we calculated the BMR of a person based on their gender,      weight in pounds, height in inches, and age in years. I found it interesting and a great challenge with doing calculations in C++ code.

* Lab 6, Part 1
I had fun with this lab as we used vectors, it wasn’t too hard and I had a good time while creating it. Making the sandwiches with whatever we chose as the ingredients was amusing to me, and I enjoyed testing random ingredients I’d never actually use on a real sandwich.

* Lab 6, Part 2
This was my favorite lab, the game blackjack is one of my top card games and it was interesting to make the game in code. It was a good amount of a challenge with using vectors, and really testing what I know so far to piece it all together.
